# Design Directions

**Before writing any code, commit to a design direction.** Don't default. Think about what this specific product needs to feel like.

## Think About Context

- **What does this product do?** A finance tool needs different energy than a creative tool.
- **Who uses it?** Power users want density. Occasional users want guidance.
- **What's the emotional job?** Trust? Efficiency? Delight? Focus?
- **What would make this memorable?** Every product has a chance to feel distinctive.

## Choose a Personality

Enterprise/SaaS UI has more range than you think. Consider these directions:

### Precision & Density

Tight spacing, monochrome, information-forward. For power users who live in the tool. Think Linear, Raycast, terminal aesthetics.

### Warmth & Approachability

Generous spacing, soft shadows, friendly colors. For products that want to feel human. Think Notion, Coda, collaborative tools.

### Sophistication & Trust

Cool tones, layered depth, financial gravitas. For products handling money or sensitive data. Think Stripe, Mercury, enterprise B2B.

### Boldness & Clarity

High contrast, dramatic negative space, confident typography. For products that want to feel modern and decisive. Think Vercel, minimal dashboards.

### Utility & Function

Muted palette, functional density, clear hierarchy. For products where the work matters more than the chrome. Think GitHub, developer tools.

### Data & Analysis

Chart-optimized, technical but accessible, numbers as first-class citizens. For analytics, metrics, business intelligence.

**Pick one. Or blend two. But commit to a direction that fits the product.**

## Choose a Color Foundation

**Don't default to warm neutrals.** Consider the product:

| Foundation                                  | Feel                               | Use When                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Warm** (creams, warm grays)               | Approachable, comfortable, human   | Collaborative tools, consumer apps |
| **Cool** (slate, blue-gray)                 | Professional, trustworthy, serious | Finance, enterprise, B2B           |
| **Pure neutrals** (true grays, black/white) | Minimal, bold, technical           | Developer tools, premium products  |
| **Tinted** (slight color cast)              | Distinctive, memorable, branded    | Products wanting strong identity   |

### Light or Dark?

Dark modes aren't just light modes inverted:

- **Dark** feels technical, focused, premium
- **Light** feels open, approachable, clean

Choose based on context and user preference.

### Accent Color

Pick ONE that means something:

- **Blue** — Trust, reliability
- **Green** — Growth, success, go
- **Orange** — Energy, attention, warmth
- **Violet** — Creativity, premium

Don't just reach for the same accent every time.

## Choose a Layout Approach

The content should drive the layout:

| Layout                 | Best For                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dense grids**        | Information-heavy interfaces where users scan and compare |
| **Generous spacing**   | Focused tasks where users need to concentrate             |
| **Sidebar navigation** | Multi-section apps with many destinations                 |
| **Top navigation**     | Simpler tools with fewer sections                         |
| **Split panels**       | List-detail patterns where context matters                |

---

## Choose Typography

Typography sets tone. Don't always default:

| Style                               | Feel                     | Use When                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **System fonts**                    | Fast, native, invisible  | Utility-focused products   |
| **Geometric sans** (Geist, Inter)   | Modern, clean, technical | Tech products, dashboards  |
| **Humanist sans** (SF Pro, Satoshi) | Warmer, approachable     | Consumer, collaborative    |
| **Monospace influence**             | Technical, data-forward  | Developer tools, analytics |
