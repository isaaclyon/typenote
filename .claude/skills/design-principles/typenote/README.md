# TypeNote Design System

The definitive design spec for TypeNote. These are **committed decisions**, not options.

## Identity

**Core Feeling:** Focused calm — like a quiet library. UI recedes; thoughts take center stage.

**Personality:** Linear's precision meets literary warmth. Sharp, intentional, keyboard-driven — with clean whites and cornflower blue.

### Principles

1. **Content-first** — UI chrome is minimal
2. **Precision without coldness** — Sharp corners, subtle borders, warm typography
3. **Keyboard-native** — Command palette (`⌘K`) is primary
4. **Balanced density** — Comfortable but efficient
5. **Calm feedback** — Soft-but-clear colors, no alarming states

### Inspirations

- **Linear** — Precision, keyboard-driven, monochrome
- **Capacities** — Type-based navigation, daily notes
- **iA Writer** — Balanced density, focused writing

### What TypeNote is NOT

- No spring/bouncy animations
- No heavy shadows or high drama
- No muddy/muted colors
